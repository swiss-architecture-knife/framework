## About swark - Swiss Architecture Knife

`swark` is a tool for software and IT architects to document their infrastructure and architecture in a readable and
structured way.

The vision for `swark` is to have a tool which combines parts of `LeanIX`, `Spark's Enterprise Architect` and `CMDBuild`
with usage of Markdown and the C4 model to give architects and their teams insight in their system environment and architecture.

## Starting with swark
`swark`'s documentation is available at [https://swiss-architecture-knife.github.io](https://swiss-architecture-knife.github.io).
Please head over there to get started.

## About us
A little publicity on our own behalf: `swark` is open source and developed by [dreitier](https://dreitier.com).
If you need support in the area of software/IT architecture or DevOps, like to get your architecture documented with `swark` or need some kind of white-label licensing, please visit us at [dreitier.com](https://dreitier.com).

## Credits
Credits where credits are due: `swark` sits on top of the [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework) framework. 
It also re-uses a lot of Laravel's approaches and also their release and CI/CD process.
Thank you, Taylor & team!
